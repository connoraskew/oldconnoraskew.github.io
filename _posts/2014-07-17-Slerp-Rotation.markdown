description: This function creates a vector for the enemy, then calculates a direction by subtracting one vector from another, finds the angle between its current direction and the target direction, then tells the object to slowly rotate to face the target rotation and finally tells the object to move backwards away from the object. The bottom line "rend.enabled = true" is used to tell the object to render and be visiable when this function is called
