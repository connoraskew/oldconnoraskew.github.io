description: This code snippet uses a private float called "current_distance_to_target" and on the other side of the brackets I use a built in calculation called ".Distance", it takes two arguments (the obejct current position and the targets Current) and calculates the distance between, because this is in the update function it re calculates everyframe so the object is always aware of how far away the target is. There is also an if statement underneath that tests if the target is within a distance we have previously specified called detection_range, if it is we move onto another function otherwise we want our renderer component set to false to make us invisible to the player
